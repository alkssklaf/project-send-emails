# project-send-emails
<h1>Overview</h1>\
This project is a simple Java application that demonstrates the use of Spring annotations to create a modular and extensible system for sending emails. The application simulates two different data sources (MySQL and PostgreSQL) that provide email addresses. The email addresses are then sent to the console, simulating the action of sending emails.
